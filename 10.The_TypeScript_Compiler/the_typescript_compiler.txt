to generate tsconfig.json file :
tsc --init

to tell typescript to complie a file everytime the file changes:
    -w or --watch
tsc -w index.ts

to complie all the ts files to js in a folder :
tsc 

to watch all the files in the folder:
tsc -w

using "files" : ["farmstand.ts","index.ts"] outside of "compilerOptions" in tsconfig.json file and using tsc command only compiles those files in the given parameter

If i want to only include files which i in a directory, then outside of "compilerOptions" in tsconfig.json use "include": ["src"]

** the file or folder path needs to be relative to tsconfig.json

"outDir": "./dist"

"target": "es2016",
